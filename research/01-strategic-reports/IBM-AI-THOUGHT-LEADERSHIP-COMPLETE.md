- **Methodology:** Global executive survey examining scaling strategies and ROI trajectories
- **Research Team:** IBM IBV AI Research Team
- **Document Type:** Strategic scaling analysis with quantitative ROI tracking
- **Format:** Web report + downloadable PDF with charts and infographics

**Description:**
Comprehensive examination of generative AI scaling strategies, ROI trajectories, implementation challenges, and organizational success factors. The research identifies three primary scaling approaches: (1) Experimentation Model - low-risk function deployment (70% in customer service, 65% in IT operations and product development), (2) Focus Model - core business function concentration despite higher risk, and (3) Platform Approach - shared AI infrastructure across departments. Documents massive confidence surge: 77% of executives now view generative AI as market-ready vs. 36% in 2023 (114% increase). Tracks operating profit from AI nearly doubling from ~2.5% (2022) to ~5% (2023) with projections to reach 10% by 2025 (300% increase from 2022 baseline). Overall AI ROI increased from 13% to 31% since 2022 (138% improvement). Two-thirds of companies successfully scale beyond pilot phases, while one-third pause after experimentation. Critical finding: 64% of CEOs say success depends more on people's adoption than technology itself. Emphasizes that "generative AI's biggest strength is to augment human work rather than automate it."

**Key Topics:** Three scaling strategies (Experimentation/Focus/Platform), function-specific adoption rates (70% customer service, 65% IT/product), confidence surge (36% to 77% market-ready perception), operating profit attribution (2.5% to 10% projected), ROI acceleration (13% to 31%), pilot-to-production success (2/3 scale successfully), augmentation vs. automation philosophy, cultural transformation requirements, data governance complexity, leadership adoption criticality (64% say people > technology)
